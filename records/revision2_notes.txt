NSF format operates using 4 sound channels, 2 pulse channels, 1 triangle, and 1 noise channel
--there's also a DPCM channel but afaik nobody ever used it

find out: 
	-what kind of bit resolution do these channels have
	-how are these channels controlled
	-what are the maximum and minimum frequency these channels can operate at
	X can these channels operate at independent frequencies
		--channels operate at independent frequencies
		--each channel is clocked using a 13 bit timer
		--each channel has its own DAC
		
-channels only play their waveform when their length-counters are not 0 (doesnt apply to pulse)
